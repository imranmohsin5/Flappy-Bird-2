Flappy Bird 2 Project

Welcome to the Flappy Bird 2 Project! This repository contains a simple Flappy Bird game created in Unity. The game features a home menu, gameplay screen, paused menu, and game end screen. The project is built using Unity's Universal Render Pipeline (URP) and utilizes TextMesh Pro for text rendering.
